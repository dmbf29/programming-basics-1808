# a box storing a value to use later

# Two ways to combine strings

# 1. Interpolation -> #{} -> double quotes
# puts "Will is #{age} years old"
# puts 'Will\'s #{age} years old'
# 2. Concatenation ->  +
# puts "Will is " + age.to_s + " years old"
# puts "he's having a birthday"
# age = age + 1
# age += 1
# puts "Now he is #{age += 1} years old"
# puts age


# age += 1
# age -= 1

print name
name = 'bart'
puts name

# puts is for display and starts a new line
# print is for display but stay on same line
# p is for debugging
